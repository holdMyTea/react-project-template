# My Basic React Project Template
~~as if GitHub haven't had too many of them already~~

Just wanted to try setting this up by myself w/o CRA, to see what's behind it.

It includes (minimalistic):
+ WebPack config
+ Babel config
+ ESLint config

### Usage
1. Clone the repo `> git clone https://github.com/holdMyTea/react-project-template`
2. Make sure you've got `nvm` installed globally - `> npm i -g nvm`
3. `> nvm use`
4. `> npm i`

###### Then
- `> npm start` to run a dev server
- `> npm run-script build` for a production build
